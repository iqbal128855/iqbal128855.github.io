I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at [University of South Carolina](https://www.cse.sc.edu/) Columbia SC. My research interest is in the area of performance optimization and debugging of highly configurable software systems. I am currently working at [AISys Lab](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/AISys/) under 
supervision of [Dr. Pooyan Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/). 

Prior to joining PhD, I worked as a System Software Engineer for three years at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) Houston TX. I completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from [University of Central Florida](https://www.ece.ucf.edu/) Orlando FL and Bachelors in Applied Physics, Electronics and Comunication Engineering from 
[University of Dhaka](http://eee.du.ac.bd/) Bangladesh.
